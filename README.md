If you're building an Android app that includes a WebView, you might run into a common problem: how to refresh the WebView without losing the current page. In this blog post, we'll show you a solution using a stack to keep track of visited URLs and reload them on refresh.

### Setting Up the Stack:
The first step in this solution is to create a Stack object to keep track of visited URLs. You can do this in your activity's onCreate() method like this:

```java
Stack<String> urlStack = new Stack<>();
urlStack.push(mainUrl);
```
Here, we're initializing a new Stack and pushing the main URL onto it. This sets up the stack so that it always has at least one URL to reload.

### Keeping Track of Visited URLs:
The next step is to update the stack every time the user visits a new URL. You can do this by overriding the WebViewClient's doUpdateVisitedHistory() method:

```java
@Override
public void doUpdateVisitedHistory(WebView view, String url, boolean isReload) {
    urlStack.push(url);
    super.doUpdateVisitedHistory(view, url, isReload);
}
```
Here, we're pushing the new URL onto the stack and calling the super method to update the WebView's history.

### Reloading the WebView:
Finally, we need to set up a way to reload the WebView without losing the current page. We can do this using a SwipeRefreshLayout and a method called LoadWeb():

```java
swipe.setOnRefreshListener(new SwipeRefreshLayout.OnRefreshListener() {
    @Override
    public void onRefresh() {
        try {
            LoadWeb();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Toast.makeText(NewWebViewActivity.this, "Something went wrong! Restart App", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }
});
```
```java
private void LoadWeb() {
    try {
        webView.loadUrl(urlStack.peek());
    } catch (Exception e) {}
}
```
Here, we're setting up a SwipeRefreshLayout and attaching an OnRefreshListener to it. When the user swipes down to refresh, we call the LoadWeb() method. This method uses the peek() method to get the top URL from the stack (without removing it), and loads it into the WebView using loadUrl().
